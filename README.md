# TEAM KALPANA-1 CANSAT-18
This contains files of Team Kalpana-1 for CANSAT'18 (Schematics,Codes,Libraries,Docs, mechanical team's files aren't included)

The material here could be haphazard and redundant,Sorry :(
Some material here isn't one person's work but of the team Kalpana-1 for CANSAT'18(Specifically the PDR & PFR have been contributed by the whole team, few other material does have contribution here and there,i.e. Schematic and Board Layout)

Libraries are not made by me, but are ones easily available online, the name and contact of the creator of those libraries are in the ZIP, if not please contact me, I will try to provide ou the creator of the files.
*Many of the codes are nothing but changes made to the examples of those librabies*
The schematic and board layout are bit erroneous to directly be fabricated, please contact the email stated below for the corrections in the final board and schematic.
DO NOT USE THE SCHEMATIC/BOARD BLINDLY
I WON'T BE MUCH HELPFUL FOR AY DOUBTS ON MECHANICAL DESIGN BUT I COULD PUT THE MESSAGE THROUGH TO THE MECHANICAL TEAM
Any queries about the codes,sensors subsystem,power subsystem,communication of board and XBee, or any general doubts about electronics subsystem could be asked at priyanshupandey7997@gmail.com.(Also feedback)
For doubts on Data handling, choice of antennas, interfacing data with computer could be better answered by Nakul(Kalpana-1 '18)
And for mechnanical design doubts are to be asked to Divyansh(Kalpana-1 '18) and Bhavya(Kalpana-1 '18) 
*Above emails not provided as permission is yet to be asked from them, but drop a mail to email stated above, I will forward mail to them*
